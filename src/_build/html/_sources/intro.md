## A Networked Approach to Church Unity

Welcome to the Pew Link Project documentation! This project aims to explore and enhance the connections between churches, fostering unity and collaboration across different congregations.

This project is designed to be a living document, evolving as we gather more insights and experiences from the church community. We encourage contributions, feedback, and discussions to help shape the future of this initiative.

The components of this project include:

- **Networked Church Directory**: A comprehensive directory of churches that allows for easy navigation and connection.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Resources and tools to facilitate collaboration between churches, including shared events, joint services, and community outreach programs.
- **Models and Simulations**: Analytical models to understand the dynamics of church networks and simulate potential outcomes of various collaborative efforts.
- **Data Analytics**: Insights derived from data collected through the network, helping to identify trends, needs, and opportunities for growth.

The main responsible for this project is [Eric Araujo](https://ericaraujo.com), professor at the [Calvin University](https://calvin.edu/).

## Why This Project?

This project is born out of a desire to see churches work together more effectively, breaking down barriers and fostering a spirit of unity. Over the two past decades we have seen an increase on the political polarization in the US and other parts of the world, and we believe that churches can play a crucial role in bridging divides and promoting understanding.

Unfortunately, many churches are struggling with division and split over issues that should not be dividing us. We believe that by creating a networked approach, we can help churches find common ground and work together towards shared goals.

The initial phase of this project is focused on building an understanding of the current landscape of church inner connections, their community difficulties, and the potentia to develop new ways of bringing people together dispite their differences. This is certainly a long-term project, but we believe that by starting now, we can make a significant impact in the future.

## What Methods Are Used?

This project employs a variety of methods to achieve its goals:

- **Data Oriented Approach**: We collect and analyze data from various sources, including church directories, community surveys, and social media interactions.
- **Social Computing**: We leverage social computing techniques to understand how churches interact and collaborate within their networks. One of the main tools used is Agent-based Modeling (ABM), which allows us to simulate the behavior of churches and their members in a networked environment.
- **Community Engagement**: We aim to actively engage with church communities to gather insights, feedback, and suggestions. This includes workshops, surveys, and online discussions.
