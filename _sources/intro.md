# Pew Link Project

## A Networked Approach to Church Unity

Welcome to the Pew Link Project documentation! This project aims to explore and enhance the connections between churches, fostering unity and collaboration across different congregations.

This project is designed to be a living document, evolving as we gather more insights and experiences from the church community. We encourage contributions, feedback, and discussions to help shape the future of this initiative.

The components of this project include:

- **Networked Church Directory**: A comprehensive directory of churches that allows for easy navigation and connection.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Resources and tools to facilitate collaboration between churches, including shared events, joint services, and community outreach programs.
- **Models and Simulations**: Analytical models to understand the dynamics of church networks and simulate potential outcomes of various collaborative efforts.
- **Data Analytics**: Insights derived from data collected through the network, helping to identify trends, needs, and opportunities for growth.

The main responsible for this project is [Eric Araujo](https://ericaraujo.com), professor at the [Calvin University](https://calvin.edu/).
