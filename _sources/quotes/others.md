> Altough the curch and the heavenly city are not synonymous or identical-and there is always an eschatological distance between the visible church and the invisible city of God--the church should strive, in Augustine's view, to become a site of prepolitical communuion with other human beings in spite of cultural, linguistic, or historical differences and distances.
