This project is about church communities being broken and split over political polarization. 

This project is about political polarization in Christian communities, both protestant and catholic. 

This will be a scholarship project aiming to bring understanding about the effects of political polarization in church communities. The main factors to be investigated are the social ties within the communities, the cognitive dissonance and self-justification mechanisms that drag people to antagonize each other, and multi-agent models based also on data to replicate such a phenomena.
